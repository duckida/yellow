# Yellow
## A simple programming language without syntax.

Write code in simple pseudo-style language and get it converted to Python! Powered by **OpenAI**.

Ex. 

Yellow:

```
roll a dice
say the word dice 
print the number rolled
```

Interpreter: 

```python
import random
num = randint(1, 6)
print("dice")
print(num)
```
To run the yellow interpreter, you can either run the file (`interpreter.py`) without an argument (opening a prompt that converts Yellow to Python), or run `interpreter.py [filename].yellow` , which will convert to Python and run the code, giving you the output.

Yellow requires an internet connection.
